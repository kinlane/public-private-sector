    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>Active, open projects are the heartbeat of any public / private sector partnership. Projects will be central to Public Private Sector operations. These projects will reflect the space with a combination of open approaches to ecosystems, platforms with healthy commercial layers that deliver value but also keep the lights on with healthy revenue generation.</p>
    
    <p>Here are a list of current projects:
    
    <ul class="mainlist">
    <li><strong>Simple API</strong> - A simple, open format approach to deploying APIs using Github, Amazon EC2 and 3Scale API platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Data Repository</strong> - A simple open data converter and storage repository that runs completely on Github, no backend required.</li>
    <li><strong>PPS API Cache</strong> - An external cache solution for web APIs, allowing a federated presence for data APIs in public and private sector.</li>
    <li><strong>PPS API Community</strong> - An external community extension of public or private sector APIs that augment existing read APIs with a community driven write API layer.</li>
    <li><strong>Interface Commons</strong> - A platform that delivers a simple and transparent mechanism for the copyright free sharing and collaborative design of API specifications, interfaces and data models.</li>
    <li><strong> Affordable Care Act Platform</strong> - A community driven approach to providing open data and API resources to support federal and local efforts around the affordable care act (ACA).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These project reflects the mission of Public Private Sector, and will drive many other smaller implementations that evolve the organizations planning, architecture and resources.</p> 
    
    <p>If you have a project you would like to suggest, please let us know and we'll discuss the best path forward.  If you'd like to sponsor or donate one of the existing projects, there are also opportunities to get involved.</p>
