    <h1>Planning</h1>
    
    <p>The private sector brings a great deal of technological talent to the table, while government possesses numbers domain experts. New models for planning and coordination between the public and private sector are emerging with programs like Code for America and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship. These initiatives are just a start, we need many more efforts to bring the public and private sector together and plan for the future of both government and markets.</p>
    
    <p>Public Private Sector is focusing on delivering planning services for government, non-profit and small to medium sized businesses in the following areas:</p>
    
    <ul class="mainlist">
        <li>Open Data Strategy - Assistance in planning and design of an agency or organizational data strategy, from inventory to deployment.</li>
        <li>API Design & Strategy - Professional support in tailoring an API strategy and resource design to support a public / private partnership.</li>
        <li>Ecosystem Modeling - Modeling of open ecosystems that invite the public, private sector businesses and government agencies to collaborate around single initiative.</li> 
        <li>Business Models - Establishing a business model that serves the greater public interest, but understands the need for commercial viability is critical to the success of any partnership.</li>
        <li>Evangelism Strategy - Helping organizations understand and realize a healthy program evangelism strategy that will educate the public, and partners about opportunities within a program ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These are just a handful of existing planning services provided by Public Private Sector. While these planning services are not focused exclusively on the public sector, we encourage businesses who would like to engage, to have some philanthropic or public sector engagement to their initiatives.</p>
    
    <p>Public Private Sector approaches to planning is derived from identifying the best of breed approaches currently being employed by top private sector businesses and forward thinking governmental organizations and non-profits.</p>  
    
    <p>A little planning goes a long way in setting the tone for any initiative between your agency, business or organization and the general public or partners.</p>
