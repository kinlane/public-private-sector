    <h2>Planning, Architecture and Resources for <br />Public / Private Sector Partnerships</h2>
     
    <p>Partnerships between the public and private sector are nothing new. However with the introduction and evolution of Internet technologies, there are new opportunities for government and the private sector to work together, in a way that still protects the public interest, but delivers enough value that the private sector will invest.</p>
    
    <p>Cities, counties, states and the federal government are facing the challenge of doing more with less, while also possessing rich resources that can help stimulate innovation across the private sector. There are a handful of existing partnerships between government and the private sector that can be showcased. There are also some new approaches emerging, as well as lots of exploration to occur.</p> 
    
    <p>Public Private Sector is about exploring this intersection of the public and private sector by focusing on:</p>

                <strong>Planning</strong><br />
                The private sector brings a great deal of technological talent to the table, while government possesses numbers domain experts. New models for planning and coordination between the public and private sector are emerging with programs like Code for America and the Presidential Innovation Fellowship. These initiatives are just a start, we need many more efforts to bring the public and private sector together and plan for the future of both government and markets.

                <strong>Architecture</strong><br />
                In the last 15 years, the private sector has dramatically shifted how business is done via social networks, the cloud and on mobile devices using Internet enabled architectural approaches.  There are new API driven approaches to defining how the government and private sector interact, boosting existing social, cloud and mobile efforts and provide meaningful analytics about the good and the bad of how government and markets work together, or even collide.

                <strong>Resources</strong><br />
                Public Private Sector is focused on identifying existing resources as well as designing, deploying and maintaining a list of technical and education resources that can be used to establish and strengthen the interaction between government and the private sector.  There are many tools being used by the private sector and in some cases the government, however there is a lack of material that actually defines how these resources can benefit both the public and the private sector through one lens.

    <p>Public Private Sector is purely about planning and delivering architecture and resources at this intersection of the public and private sector. Technology and data is not good, nor evil or neutral by default. We can't assume any of the current approaches to opening up government or entrepreneurialism or traditional business operations are always good and benefit the public or even markets.</p>
    
    <p>This site and the Public Private Sector organization is dedicated to projects in this important space. This is a brand new effort, and next steps will involve establishing a 501c(3) organizational structure, as well as launching several projects that are already in motion.</p>
