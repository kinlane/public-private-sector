  <h1>Public / Private Sector
  <p>I am fascinated by the power of the government. Lately I'm also mesmerized by the power of the private sector, and specifically Silicon Valley.</p>
  <p>Can you image what the two can do, if they get together in a sensible way that protects the public interest, but empowers the private sector as well.</p>
  <p>Currently I am almost two months into a Presidential Innovation Fellow, where I am working for the federal government as a G-14 employee, fresh from the private sector.</p>
  <p>As expected, I hit the thick, beuacratic sludge of the federal government that I expected, and while I'm pushing forward and finding a way to deal, I'm struggling with a pretty immovable obstacle--the current federal government shutdown.</p>
  <p>As I do with every aspect of my existence, I setup a domain, a blog, and begin to work through my thoughts. This represents my thoughts on what truly is possible with a public / private sector partnership.</p>
  <p>Right now this site will reflect my own thoughts coming from the private sector and being placed within the federal government, but it will quickly evolve into what public / private sector partnerships can truly look like.</p>
  <p>This site will change daily, if the government shutdown goes on longer than expected, it might change much quicker.</p>
