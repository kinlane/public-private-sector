I am two months into my Presidential Innovation Fellowship. While I'm enjoying my dedicated time (being paid) hacking on government data, making public data assets, designing APIs and building tools, I have hit a wall.

I have been been making significant progress with opening up data, designing and even deploying APIs across multiple agencies, and many other side projects including opening up government services via JSON and generating educational resources as I go along.

All the challenges I'm facing are doable, well except for this government shutdown. Beyond that there is only one thing I'm questioning: the need to be within federal government to do this. I would say there are two things that are making me successful, 1) getting paid 2) I'm in DC. Actually being a federal government employee actually seems to be the part that is slowing me down.

I'm currently racing the clock to get enough data open and APIs deployed to support a hackathon in NYC next week to support veterans. I have until monday to get this assets available for people to build applications during the hackathon, this is when the VA website will go silent, but also I'm legally responsible to NOT work on my VA projects, if the government shuts VA down.

This is a show stopper for me. I don't know how to turn off my work like a faucet. I am not an employee. I obsess over this stuff. Once I get going on a project I will do it until I'm done. Weekends, evenings, days or whatever. 

My nature, the rules of government have caused me to purchase this domain and setup this site.  I feel there is a better approach to public / private sector work. There are some models out there currently, but I want to define more.

This is the beginning...we will see where it goes!
