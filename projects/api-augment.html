    <p>There are thousands of APIs available on the open Internet today. The majority of these APIs provide access to valuable data, allowing developers to GET data in a machine readable format such as JSON or XML.</p>

    <p>Most of these data APIs are read only, allowing developers to GET the data and use in their websites and applications, but not actually write the data back to the API, even though there are common approaches for doing this via APIs using POST for adding, PUT for updating and DELETE for removing records.</p> 

    <p>Public Private Sector API Augment is a model for adding POST, PUT and DELETE to existing read-only APIs who currently just provide GET capabilities to developers.</p>

    <p>There are numerous reasons why a business, organization or government agency would not want to allow for developers to write to valuable data repositories, ranging from lack or resources to concerns around legal liability.</p>  

    <p>Public Private Sector API Augment model allows for augmenting existing data APIs, adding write capabilities, but does it in an external way that is layered on top of Github, using JSON stores which gather data that is written, updated and deleted from an existing API resource.</p>

    <p>API communities can exist outside of a companies, organization or agencies firewall outside their legal responsibility, but allow for community or public interaction around a valuable dataset, potentially maintaining data as a community effort.</p>

    <p>API community is not a proprietary model, but an open blueprint that can be implemented by anyone.  Public Private Sector will implement by request for approved projects, and will be tackling some high value public and private sector targets.</p>
