    <p>Opening up data takes tools for conversion, processing and storage. The Open Data Repository is about providing a single set of tools for managing open data in a single Github repository.</p>

    <p>Github is the base storage for the Open Data Repository, but open formats like HTML, JavaScript and JSON are used to make it work.</p>  

    <p>The goal is to provide a single toolkit that government agencies, non-profit organizations and even companies can use to open up single or multiple data sets for public consumption.</p>

    <p>The Open Data Repository is available to be forked, and implemented by anyone, but if you'd like help please let Public Private Sector know and we'll work to help.</p>
