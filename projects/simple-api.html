    <p>Simple API is meant to provide a simple platform for easily deploying common types of basic APIs. The goal is to provide companies, organizations and government agencies with not just the blueprint for common APIs, but also the means to easily and deploy APIs.</p>

    <p>90% of Simple API is designed to run on Github as a Github Page, using Github repositories as a backend.  The remaining 10% runs on Amazon EC2 using a PHP / REST Framework called Slim. The Slim portion is meant to monitor the forked repositories of API templates and provide a connected API.</p>

    <p>Simple API is designed to provide common blueprints for design and deployment of APIs, but also act as an educational resources about how APIs are designed and deployed, assisting data owners in better understanding how APIs work.</p>

    <p>Right now there are ust a handful of API designs available on Simple API, and the deployment is only available to a controlled audience. However the approach is open source and can be deployed by anyone.</p>
