    <p>I've been working the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to open up data and APIs that support veterans. Even though I'm working on larger open data and API inventory and rollout efforts, I needed to escalate the opening up of data, deployment of APIs so that I could support a hackathon, but also be able to build tools to show what was possible.</p>
    
    <p>I understand that processes within government to open up data and deploy APIs takes longer, but for me it is something that can happen very quickly and is only the first step. I want to quickly get to developer forms, widgets, visualizations and other tools and resources on top of open data and APis--demonstrating to the world what is possible.</p>
    
    <p>Many people want to inventory the entire landscape, carefully think about the process of what data should be opened. This is fine, but here is also some low hanging fruit that is evident on the public VA websites. This is where I targeted, and quickly downloaded and scraped datasets and got to work cleaning up, publishing as JSON and building API interfaces.</p>
    
    <p>As with all Public Private Sector projects, work on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) data is available via a central Github repository at <a href="http://va-data.github.io/va-developer/" target="_blank">http://va-data.github.io/va-developer/</a>, and individually as separate repositories under a single Github organization at <a href="https://github.com/va-data" target="_blank">https://github.com/va-data</a>.</p>
