    <p>The Affordable Care Act(ACA), also known as ObamaCare recently launched via the site Healthcare.gov and a network of state marketplaces. The website employs some forward leaning approaches to publishing content using Jekyll, and was showcasing the entire site usin Github, until it was recently taken down.</p>
    
    <p>The overall launch has been pretty rocky, with lots of speculation of what went wrong, but it looks like it was isolated to the Health and Human Services (HHS) identity system. Currently individuals are able to register, but there are plenty of problems being reported. Only time will tell if the iniative is able to meet its target goals.</p>
    
    <p>There is a great deal of open data and content available as part of the overall launch, however it isn't readily visible or usable by developers and 3rd party groups. If you have the awareness and motivation to find the datasets on Socrata or understand the Jekyll inner workings of Healthcare.gov you can pull it together, but there is no single platform to find and work with ACA data and content.</p>
    
    <p>This project will work to aggregate, transform and manage various data and content sets around ACA and make available using modern approaches to open data and API platforms. Like other Public Private Sector projects, ACA work will be ongoing and hopefully encourage contributions from other individuals and groups.</p>
    
    <p>When ready, I will like the supporting repository here, and update with other important links.</p>
