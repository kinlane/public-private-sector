    <p>It is great that government is opening up data to the public for download and via APIs, however some government agencies are not the best at keeping data available and providing optimal service level agreements (SLA).</p> 

    <p>API cache is an approach to caching the data made available via public APIs in a way that can be syndicated, reused and made available, even when the original source of data goes away temporarily or permanently.</p>  

    <p>The goal of API cache is not to replace original sources of data, but provided a replicated version of the data, making sure data assets are available at any time, while also allowing city, county, state, government agencies and organizations or businesses to help share the load when it comes to API availability.</p> 

    <p>API Cache is not a proprietary product, it is a blueprint available that anyone can implement.  Public, Private Sector will be pushing forward different approaches to API Cache, hopefully evolving this approach to API availability.</p> 

    <p>If you have a API you'd like to see cached, let us know.</p>
