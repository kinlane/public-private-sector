    <h2>Resources</h2>
     
    <p>Public Private Sector is focused on identifying existing resources as well as designing, deploying and maintaining a list of technical and education resources that can be used to establish and strengthen the interaction between government and the private sector.  There are many tools being used by the private sector and in some cases the government, however there is a lack of material that actually defines how these resources can benefit both the public and the private sector through one lens.</p>
    
    <p>There are several areas focus on when it comes to providing resources to this space:</p>
    
    <ul class="mainlist">
        <li><strong>Tooling</strong> - Code snippets, libraries and full applications that can be used in public / private sector partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Guides</strong> - Business and technical guides for execution of common solutions in the public / private sector space.</li>
        <li><strong>Case Studies</strong> - Actual studies that showcase real world examples of healthy public / private sector partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding</strong> - Identifying and exploring various opportunities for funding of projects and initiatives in the space.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>All Public Private Sector resources will be defined through real world deployments for active projects. Tooling, guides and case studies will be developed in real-time, as part of every active project initiative. This approach to open development and storytelling is not just central to our approach, but is important to a wider, healthier ecosystem of interactions between the public and private sector.</p>
    
    <p>Resources will act as the open blueprint, providing a different type of scale to Public Private Sector operations, where it isn't always optimal to scale the organization itself, but providing blueprints will allow other organizations to implement for themselves or on behalf of other initiatives.</p>
    
    <p>Open resources are fundamental to strong interactions between the public and private sector.</p>
