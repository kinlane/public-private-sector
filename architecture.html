    <h1>Architecture</h1>
     
    <p>In the last 15 years, the private sector has dramatically shifted how business is done via social networks, the cloud and on mobile devices using Internet enabled architectural approaches.  There are new API driven approaches to defining how the government and private sector interact, boosting existing social, cloud and mobile efforts and provide meaningful analytics about the good and the bad of how government and markets work together, or even collide.
    
    <p>There is a lot to be learned on both sides of public and private sector partnerships when it comes to technology. Public Private Sector is about identifying healthy approaches to the deployment and management of technology that facilitates healthy public / private sector partnerships in the following areas:
    
    <ul class="mainlist">
        <li>Open Data Solutions - Inventorying, publishing and operations of an open data ecosystem for single or multiple data assets for individual agencies, groups or crowdsourced, community efforts.</li>
        <li>API Deployment - Design, deployment and management of APIs to support open data efforts as well as provide the backend for web, mobile, widget, spreadsheet, visualizations and other public / private sector solutions.</li>
        <li>Cloud Infrastructure - Identifying of viable cloud infrastructure that can be used by public / private sector initiatives including architectural design, setup, management and support of ongoing iniatives.</li>
        <li>Mobile Backends - Establishing approaches to designing, deploying and managing single or aggregate data and API resources for support of mobile application development, providing necessary backend support.</li>
        <li>Developer Portals - Providing design, development and deployment of developer portals to support data and API driven public / private sector partner ecosystems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are proven techniques for deploying modern data, API, cloud and mobile architecture that drives collaboration in the private sector, with a handful of city, state, county and federal adoption as well. What is needed is a push to define, deploy and manage architectural solutions with both the public and private sector in mind, with a focus on enhancing collaboration between these two types of entities.
    
    <p>Public Private Sector will focus on architecture that best serves this area, keeping in tune with the fast moving technology space, while understand which approaches are the best fit for the sometimes slower moving public sector.
    
    <p>While open source architecture is often the better fit for public sector deployments, a mix of open and proprietary tools will be considered to find the best balance possible for public, private sector partnerships.
